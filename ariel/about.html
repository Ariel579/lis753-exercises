    <h1>ARIEL JONES</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <hr>
    <p>While working at the library I attended Robert Morris College studying graphic design as a major. Graphic design is a study of typography, painting, photography and web designing. Graphic design for me is a visual way to communicate and promote an idea.</p>

<p>I discovered art with painting and drawing, but later I saw that graphic design could do as much as art but in a more personal way. Graphic design also has the power
to express any idea, thought or feeling, by using more mediums and delivery methods to achieve a better communication with others, professionally and personally. </p>
<p>Using my skill and graphic design and education background, I designed a flyer
which inspired patrons to come out to the programs and all the access all that the library has to offer. I also create art and craft by hand for fun learning activities. I have painting classes for seniors where they can express the inner artistic skills through the stroke of a brush.</p>

<p>Being a librarian will be very beneficial to me helping the community in which I live. The library is historically the number one place in life that contains collections of books, periodicals, film, and recorded music for people to read or borrow. Further education would certainly enrich me as well as prepare me for a better and more productive career in the library sciences of library use and resources.
